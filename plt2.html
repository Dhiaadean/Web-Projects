         <p>
             <br> 

             <br>1-The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing:
             <br>
             <br>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years, although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day will have increased to 25 hours.
             <br>
             <br>2-The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.
             <br>
             <br>3-Earth has a powerful magnetic field:
             <br>
             <br>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.
             <br>
             <br>4-There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.
             <br>
             <br>5-Earth is the only planet not named after a god:
             <br>
             <br>The other seven planets in our solar system are all named after Roman gods or goddesses. Although only Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were named during ancient times, because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman method of naming planets was retained after the discovery of Uranus and Neptune.
             <br>
             <br>6-The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.
             <br>
             <br>This varies according to the part of the planet; for example, the metallic core is denser than the crust. The average density of the Earth is approximately 5.52 grams per cubic centimetre.
             <br>
             <br>

         <p>
            <br> 

             <br>1-Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass:
             <br>
             <br>Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the Earth’s mass, around two thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s
             <br>
             <br>2-Mars is home to the tallest mountain in the solar system.
             <br>
             <br>3-Only 18 missions to Mars have been successful:
             <br>
             <br>As of September 2014 there have been 40 missions to Mars, including orbiters, landers and rovers but not counting flybys. The most recent arrivals include the Mars Curiosity mission in 2012, the MAVEN mission, which arrived on September 22, 2014, followed by the Indian Space Research Organization’s MOM Mangalyaan orbiter, which arrived on September 24, 2014. The next missions to arrive will be the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, comprising an orbiter, lander, and a rover, followed by NASA’s InSight robotic lander mission, slated for launch in March 2016 and a planned arrival in September, 2016.
             <br>
             <br>4-Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system.
             <br>
             <br>5-On Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on Earth:
             <br>
             <br>6-Mars takes its name from the Roman god of war.
             <br>
             <br>7-There are signs of liquid water on Mars.
             <br>
             <br>8-Sunsets on Mars are blue.
             <br>
             <br>9-Pieces of Mars have fallen to Earth.

         <p>
            <br> 

            <br>1-Mercury does not have any moons or rings.
            <br>
            <br>2-Mercury is the smallest planet.
            <br>3-Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and Mercury is only the second hottest planet.
            <br>
            <br>4-Your weight on Mercury would be 38% of your weight on Earth.
            <br>
            <br>5-A day on the surface of Mercury lasts 176 Earth days.
            <br>
            <br>6-Only two spacecraft have ever visited Mercury:
            <br>
            <br>Owing to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is a difficult planet to visit. During 1974 and 1975 Mariner 10 flew by Mercury three times, during this time they mapped just under half of the planet’s surface. On August 3rd 2004, the Messenger probe was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, this was the first spacecraft to visit since the mid 1970’s.
            <br>
            <br>7-It’s not known who discovered Mercury.

 <h1 id="P4">Venus :</h1>

         <p>
            <br> 

            <br>1-Venus does not have any moons or rings.
            <br>
            <br>2-Venus is nearly as big as the Earth with a diameter of 12,104 km.
            <br>
            <br>3-Venus is thought to be made up of a central iron core, rocky mantle and silicate crust.
            <br>
            <br>4-A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) would appear to take 117 Earth days.
            <br>
            <br>5-The surface temperature on Venus can reach 471 °C.
            <br>
            <br>6-Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets.
            <br>
            <br>7-Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky.
            <br>
            <br>8-The Russians sent the first mission to Venus.
            <br>
            <br>The Venera 1 space probe was launched in 1961, but lost contact with base. The USA also lost their first probe to Venus, Mariner 1, although Mariner 2 was able to take measurements of the planet in 1962. The Soviet Union’s Venera 3 was the first man-made craft to land on Venus in 1966.

            <br>
            <br>This was a Soviet craft, which was launched from the USSR. It passed within 5995 km of the surface of the Moon before going into orbit around the Sun.

            <br>6-TDuring the 1950’s the USA considered detonating a nuclear bomb on the Moon.

            <br>
            <br>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.

                <p>
                    <br> Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and is the fifth planet out from the Sun. It is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant”.

                <p>
                    <br> Best known for its fabulous ring system, Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in our solar system. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant and is composed of similar gasses including hydrogen, helium and methane.

        <h1>Uranus :</h1>
          <div class="planetsdescription" >
              <p>
                  <br> Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. It is often described as “rolling around the Sun on its side.”

        <h1>Neptune :</h1>
         <div class="planetsdescription" >
              <p>
                  <br> Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun, making it the most distant in the solar system. This gas giant may have formed much closer to the Sun in the early solar system history before migrating out to its current position.

         <div class="planetsdescription" >
              <p>
                  <br> The Sun is the star at the centre of our solar system . It is an almost perfect sphere of super-hot gases whose gravity holds the solar system together. The energy produced by the Sun is essential for life on Earth and is a driving force behind the Earth’s weather.

                 <p>
                     <br> The Moon (or Luna) is the Earth’s only natural satellite and was formed 4.6 billion years ago around some 30–50 million years after the formation of the solar system. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth meaning the same side is always facing the Earth.
